# Neural-Networks-Project---Intro-to-Machine-Learning
A project implementing a nonlinear logistic regression classifier by utilizing neural networks. The basic neural networks were implemented without the use of TensorFlow, and the results of the classifier were compared to others that didn't use neural networks.
